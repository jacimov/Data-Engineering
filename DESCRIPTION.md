# Data Engineering Project Description

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Engineering and Distributed Environments course at CMU. The goal is to develop a complete data pipeline that demonstrates proficiency in database management, data processing, and cloud computing concepts.

## Technical Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Cloud Platform**: TBD based on project requirements
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## Project Components

### 1. Database Design and Implementation
- Design and create database schemas
- Implement table relationships and constraints
- Optimize database performance

### 2. Data Pipeline Development
- Create ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
- Implement data validation and cleaning
- Develop automated data ingestion workflows

### 3. Python Scripts and Tools
- Database interaction scripts
- Data processing utilities
- Automated reporting tools

### 4. Cloud Integration
- Deploy database to cloud platform
- Implement cloud-based data processing
- Set up automated cloud workflows

## Project Timeline
The project will be completed in several phases throughout the semester:
1. Phase 1: Database Design and Setup
2. Phase 2: Basic Data Pipeline Implementation
3. Phase 3: Cloud Integration
4. Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
5. Final Phase: Documentation and Deployment

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate understanding of database design principles
- Create efficient and scalable data pipelines
- Show proficiency in cloud computing concepts
- Implement industry best practices for data engineering
- Develop maintainable and well-documented code

## Documentation
All project components will be documented in this repository, including:
- Setup instructions
- Database schemas
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Deployment guides

## Testing
The project includes:
- Unit tests for Python scripts
- Integration tests for data pipelines
- Performance testing for database queries
- End-to-end testing for complete workflows

## Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future development:
- Real-time data processing capabilities
- Advanced analytics integration
- Machine learning pipeline integration
- Dashboard development for data visualization

## Contributing
This is a personal course project, but suggestions and feedback from course staff and peers are welcome through the appropriate channels (course discussions, office hours, etc.).
