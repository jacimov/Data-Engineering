## Course Description
This course introduces the fundamental principles of data engineering, focusing on relational databases and distributed databases in the cloud. Students will learn SQL, practice using Python to query databases, and be introduced to cloud computing. The course is primarily designed for students in the Master of Science in Applied Data Science program.

### Prerequisites
Students should have prior experience with:
- Programming in Python (e.g., through 36-650)
- Using Git
- Working from the command-line shell

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Design SQL tables to store complex, frequently updated data
- Write SQL queries to group, aggregate, and summarize data stored in multiple interconnected tables
- Use Python to execute SQL queries and dynamically act upon stored data
- Load data into SQL databases and update existing data
- Develop Python data pipelines that ingest data from multiple sources
- Run data pipelines on cloud computing resources
- Work with data stored in distributed file systems

## Academic Integrity
Students are encouraged to discuss homework and projects with classmates, but all submitted work must be their own. External sources may be used for reference and support, but not for copying code or solutions. All external sources must be properly cited.

### Generative AI Policy
While generative AI tools can be helpful for explanation and debugging, they must only support student work, not replace it. Direct copying of AI-generated solutions is considered unauthorized assistance under the University Policy on Academic Integrity.

## Accommodations and Support
Students with disabilities are encouraged to discuss accommodation needs with the instructor and contact the Office of Disability Resources (access@andrew.cmu.edu).

## Diversity and Inclusion
CMU is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Students experiencing or witnessing bias or discrimination can report incidents through:
- Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
- Report-It online anonymous reporting platform (username: tartans, password: plaid)
